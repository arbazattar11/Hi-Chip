# HiChIP Data Analysis Pipeline

This pipeline is designed to analyze HiChIP sequencing data. Below are the steps involved:

1. **Quality Control (QC):**
   - FASTQ files are checked for quality using FastQC, and a summary report is generated using MultiQC.

2. **Read Alignment:**
   - Reads are aligned to the reference genome using BWA.

3. **Peak Calling:**
   - MACS2 is used to call peaks representing protein-DNA interactions.

4. **Quality Control of Peaks:**
   - MultiQC generates a report to assess the quality of called peaks.

5. **Annotation and Visualization:**
   - Identified peaks are annotated with genomic features using annotatePeaks.pl, and a profile plot is generated.

6. **Differential Binding Analysis (Optional):**
   - Differential binding analysis can be performed if comparing between different experimental conditions.

7. **Functional Enrichment Analysis:**
   - Functional enrichment analysis of peaks can be performed using external tools like GREAT or Enrichr.

8. **Interaction Calling:**
   - Hi-C analysis is performed to detect chromatin interactions between genomic regions.

9. **Integration of HiChIP and Interaction Data:**
   - HiChIP and Hi-C data can be integrated to understand the higher-order organization of chromatin.

10. **Visualization and Interpretation:**
   - Results are visualized using genome browsers and interpreted to gain insights into chromatin regulation.

## Usage
- Clone this repository.
- Place your FASTQ files in the same directory as the pipeline script.
- Modify the script as necessary to specify paths and parameters.
- Run the pipeline using `./pipeline.sh`.

## Requirements
- BWA
- MACS2
- FastQC
- MultiQC
- deeptools (for annotatePeaks.pl and plotProfile)
- Hi-C analysis tools (if performing interaction calling)

## Notes
- Ensure reference genome files are available and properly indexed.
- Adjust parameters and additional analysis steps based on specific experimental needs.
