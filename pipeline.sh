# Step 1: Quality Control
fastqc -o qc_reports/ *.fastq

# Step 2: Read Alignment
bwa index reference_genome.fa
bwa mem -t 4 reference_genome.fa sample1.fastq sample2.fastq > aligned_reads.sam

# Step 3: Peak Calling
macs2 callpeak -t aligned_reads.bam -n peaks --outdir peaks/

# Step 4: Quality Control of Peaks
multiqc peaks/

# Step 5: Annotation and Visualization
annotatePeaks.pl peaks/peaks.narrowPeak hg38 > annotated_peaks.txt
plotProfile -m aligned_reads.bam -out profile.pdf

# Step 6: Differential Binding Analysis (Optional)
# Perform if comparing between conditions

# Step 7: Functional Enrichment Analysis
# Perform using external tools like GREAT or Enrichr

# Step 8: Interaction Calling
# Perform Hi-C analysis using specialized tools

# Step 9: Integration of HiChIP and Interaction Data
# Combine and analyze HiChIP and Hi-C data

# Step 10: Visualization and Interpretation
# Visualize results using genome browsers and interpret findings
